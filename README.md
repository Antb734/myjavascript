I made a github shortly after starting college for my BA in software dev; however, I did not use it mainly because I had a lot to learn still.  I still do, but i'm spending a lot more time coding on my own time now outside of the classroom.  I'm also working through some udemy courses starting with JavaScript.  I'll be working on Java after that and maybe some others soon too.  I decided to start sharing as I go with some small challenges I do on my own or that the courses take me though.  

I figure it's never to early to establish a presence, so when i'm ready to start working in the industry I won't have to try so hard to get my work out here for people to see.  Maybe i'll get some good feedback to help me improve too or even get invited to work on an open source project!  Right now I work a regular old job not in the programming industry and I would like to change that sooner rather than later.  I have about 2 and 1/2 years before I finsih my degree, but if I can show i'm useful maybe i'll find my way in sooner!!!

Looking forward to being a part of the github community!
